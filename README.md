## How to set up a development environment 

* .Net Core 3.0 or newer. If you don't yet have the SDK installed yet, we recommend downloading it from [Mirosoft .NET Download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
* Your preferred development environment. For example, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Also useful to install are the [C# extension for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/dotnet) and the [solution explorer plugin for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fernandoescolar.vscode-solution-explorer)
